          <p>
          Ernie’s Ride 2018 is an unsupported (no assistance vehicle) ride on August 3-5 (Friday – Sunday).  This challenging ride is an event created to raise funds, prayers, and awareness for two pro-life women’s centers here in Warren &amp; Butler Counties.  The Community Pregnancy Center is located in Middletown, OH, while Elizabeth's New Life Center is located in my hometown, Lebanon, OH.
          <br>
          <br>
          The premise of the ride is very straight-forward:  Riders complete as much of the 320-mile distance between the Ohio River, in Cincinnati, and Lake Erie, in Cleveland, during the 3-day event.  You, if you’d like, sponsor a rider a set amount per mile.  When the weekend is over, you make your donation directly to the Center you have chosen based on the total number of miles (320-mile max) your sponsored rider has covered. 
          <br>
          <br>
          To sponsor, just visit the “Sponsor” section, and pick the rider you want to sponsor and the Center to which you wish to donate.  Then tell us your name, email address, City, and State, and the amount per mile you are sponsoring.  The website will even calculate your maximum commitment for you!  After the ride, we email you with the final total of your sponsorship and a link, address, and instructions to fulfill your pledge.  We don’t handle the money.  Your donation goes directly to the Center!
          <br>
          <br>
          You might say: “Why don’t I just give a set amount?”  Well, you could.  And, you can.  Anytime.  But that’s not what we are doing here.  We are making a focused push to challenge ourselves to give big.  The ride is part of your motivation to do so.  Your per-mile pledge is THE motivation for riders to keep pedaling and to share the benefits of their joy of riding.  As the miles roll by, and fatigue creeps in, we will continue to pedal knowing that each mile means life to women, babies, and families in our area.
          <br>

          Please sponsor generously!

          Godspeed,

        <p>This 3-day event is August 3-5 (Friday – Sunday).  Riders are required to obtain sponsors totaling at least $2.00 per mile.  This is pretty easy to do using social media.  Riders are responsible for all of their own food &amp; lodging over the 3 days &amp; two nights.  No sponsored monies are used for the riders’ expenses.  So, it is quite a sacrifice, but it is well worth it.  The ride follows the route of the Ohio to Erie Trail which is dedicated bike trail about 85% of the way and a few roads for the remaining miles.  Most of the roads we cycle are lightly travelled by cars and a premium is placed on cyclist safety.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Friday departs from Paul Brown Stadium at 6:00 AM and covers about 112 miles to Columbus.  Saturday departs the hotel in Columbus and covers about 103 miles to Millersburg, Ohio.  On Sunday, we depart our hotel in Millersburg and cover the final 105 miles to Edgewater Park on Lake Erie in Cleveland.  Stops are made daily as needed for rest, refueling, and recharging.  In 2017, the stops were (in order) Spring Valley, London, Columbus, Sunbury, Mount Vernon, Millersburg, Canal Fulton, Peninsula, and Cleveland.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The Ernie’s Ride Custom Cycling Kit is available for purchase by any rider.  Cost is dependent on how many pieces are being ordered.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Finally, Ernie’s Ride is open to both male &amp; female riders.  However, accountability, propriety, and responsibility may limit the number of riders we can accept.  If you would like to ride, please email us at erniesride@gmail.com.  We will be glad to provide registration details and answers to any questions you may have.   Deadline to register to ride Ernie’s Ride 2018 is June 30, 2018.</p>
