          Ernie’s Ride 2017 is an unsupported (no assistance vehicle), solo ride I will be attempting on the first weekend of June this year.  It is a challenge that was created to raise funds, prayers, and awareness for the Community Pregnancy Center which serves women in Butler &amp; Warren Counties.  The premise is quite simple:  I ride as much of the 320-mile distance between the Ohio River in Cincinnati and Lake Erie in Cleveland as I can on a Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  You, if you’d like, sponsor me a set amount per mile and, when the weekend is over, you make your donation directly to the Community Pregnancy Center based on the total number of miles (320-mile max) that I ride.  To do so, just visit the “Sponsor” section below, and give us the amount per mile &amp; your email address.  The website will even calculate your maximum commitment for you!  After the ride, we email you with the actual total of your sponsorship and a link, address, and instructions to fulfill your pledge.  I don’t handle the money! &#9786;
          <br>
          <br>
          You might say:  “Why don’t I just give a set amount?”  Well, you could.  And, you can.  Anytime.  But that’s not what we are doing here.  We are making a focused push to challenge ourselves to give big.  The ride is part of your motivation to do so.  Your per-mile pledge is <u>THE</u> motivation for me to keep pedaling and to share the benefits of my joy of riding.  As the miles roll by, and fatigue creeps in, I continue to pedal knowing that each mile means life to women, babies, and families in our area.
          <br>

          My best friend, Phil Hamlin, used to go to a drive-in restaurant (yeah, car-hops and such) in Indiana to sell GRIT newspapers as a child.  He’d put on old, tattered clothes and go looking as poor &amp; pitiful as he could in order to sell more papers.  Let me put on my old clothes:  I’m a 57 year-old, bald, gray-bearded guy who had back surgery a few years ago.  My <i>glory days</i> were being good enough to make a team only to give the good players someone to practice against.  And now, I’m going to try to ride 320 miles in 3 days?

        <h1>Doug and Ernie's Story</h1>
        <p>
        I’m no professional cyclist. I work my 40-hour week at a fantastic flavor company in Lebanon, Ohio, that provides all that is needed for me to be able to cycle to work most any day. It is a blessing, for sure! I also am an ordained minister in the Church of the Nazarene and assist a very good friend who pastors a small non-denominational church in downtown Lebanon. I am married to my college sweetheart, Judy, and we are blessed with two sons &amp; a daughter (-in-law) of whom we are tremendously proud – Andrew &amp; Tim &amp; Courtney. 
        <br>

        This event is called “Ernie’s Ride” in honor of my late Uncle Ernie who was born and lived 58 years with Down Syndrome. His life taught me what it meant to be loved &amp; valued no matter the circumstance. I miss him. I was honored to have him for an uncle. You can read a little more about him on the <a href="/meeternie">"Meet Ernie"</a> page.
        <br>
        <br>
        I’m no professional cyclist (Have I mentioned that?), but I enjoy riding and I thrive on challenging myself. And this ride will definitely be a challenge. I’ve done this just once before – in 2014. Last summer I rode more miles in a season than I ever had before and I’ve been training this winter in the hope of completing it in June at age 57. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I invite you to join me by making a per-mile pledge. It will encourage &amp; inspire me to know that every new mile I cover is making a difference for unborn children &amp; their moms. Will I make it all the way to Lake Erie in 2017? I don’t know. But I will do my best! Please do your best for the unborn by making your per-mile pledge today. Your actual donation won’t be collected until after we discover how many miles of “Ernie’s Ride” I was able to complete. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Thank you for joining with me to honor my Uncle Ernie &amp; to help new moms and their babies through the Community Pregnancy Center.
        <br>
        <br>
        Godspeed!
