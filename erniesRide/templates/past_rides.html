    <p>Brian Messer, Chad Settlage, Tim Settlage, & I commenced pedaling at Paul Brown Stadium in Cincinnati at 6:05 AM on Friday, August 3, 2018, with a goal of Lake Erie by Sunday afternoon.   This first leg would be our longest - - covering 60 miles before a late breakfast stop at Slimâ€™s in Spring Valley.  Just 8 miles in, we encountered unforeseen road construction which puzzled us for a few minutes, but we found our way around  it and stayed on course through Mariemont and onto the Little Miami River Trail just before mile 13.  Riding under a canopy of trees for most of the way, we pulled into Spring Valley before 10:30.</p>
